The app should allow users to:\n- Browse and search song data, including relationships between songs, authors, artists, and record labels.\n- Perform CRUD operations for privileged users (Admin and Contributor roles).\n- Create and log in to user accounts with role-based access control (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nUse Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux or Context API for state management. Ensure the UI is intuitive and mobile-friendly.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Prompt for Backend Development**\n```plaintext\nDevelop a scalable backend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Node.js and Express.js. The backend should:\n- Provide RESTful API endpoints for the frontend and external apps.\n- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\n- Include authentication and authorization using Passport.js or Auth0 with JWT.\n- Handle CRUD operations for entities like Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label.\n- Use PostgreSQL as the database, with Sequelize or Prisma as the ORM.\nDocument the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Prompt for Database Design**\n```plaintext\nDesign a relational database schema for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using PostgreSQL. The schema should include:\n- A \"Song\" table with attributes like title, release date, and genre.\n- An \"Author\" table with attributes like name and biography.\n- An \"Artist\" table with attributes like name and discography.\n- A \"Record Label\" table with attributes like name and location.\n- A \"User\" table with attributes like username, email, password, and role (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nDefine relationships between these tables (e.g., many-to-many between Song and Artist). Ensure the schema is normalized and scalable.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Prompt for Hosting and Deployment**\n```plaintext\nProvide a deployment plan for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" that uses:\n- React.js for the frontend, hosted on Vercel.\n- Node.js with Express.js for the backend, hosted on Render.\n- PostgreSQL for the database, hosted on Supabase or Railway.\nEnsure the deployment is cost-effective (free tier) and includes CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Prompt for Authentication and Authorization**\n```plaintext\nImplement authentication and authorization for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Passport.js or Auth0. The system should:\n- Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.\n- Use JWT for session management.\n- Support role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: Admin, Contributor, and Basic.\n- Restrict CRUD operations to Admin and Contributor roles.\nProvide detailed documentation for integrating the authentication system with the frontend and backend.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Prompt for Testing**\n```plaintext\nWrite unit and integration tests for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Jest and Cypress. The tests should cover:\n- Frontend components (React.js) for browsing, searching, and CRUD operations.\n- Backend API endpoints (Node.js + Express.js) for authentication, role management, and CRUD operations.\n- Database interactions (PostgreSQL) for reading and writing data.\nEnsure the tests are comprehensive and include edge cases.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Prompt for API Documentation**\n```plaintext\nGenerate API documentation for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation should include:\n- Endpoints for CRUD operations on Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label entities.\n- Authentication endpoints for login and user management.\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) details for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\nProvide example requests and responses for each endpoint.\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!",

Frontend Development\n```\nDesign a modern, responsive frontend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using React.js. The app should allow users to:\n- Browse and search song data, including relationships between songs, authors, artists, and record labels.\n- Perform CRUD operations for privileged users (Admin and Contributor roles).\n- Create and log in to user accounts with role-based access control (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nUse Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux or Context API for state management. Ensure the UI is intuitive and mobile-friendly.\n```\n\n## 2. Backend Development\n```\nDevelop a scalable backend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Node.js and Express.js. The backend should:\n- Provide RESTful API endpoints for the frontend and external apps.\n- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\n- Include authentication and authorization using Passport.js or Auth0 with JWT.\n- Handle CRUD operations for entities like Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label.\n- Use PostgreSQL as the database, with Sequelize or Prisma as the ORM.\nDocument the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.\n```\n\n## 3. Database Design\n```\nDesign a relational database schema for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using PostgreSQL. The schema should include:\n- A \"Song\" table with attributes like title, release date, and genre.\n- An \"Author\" table with attributes like name and biography.\n- An \"Artist\" table with attributes like name and discography.\n- A \"Record Label\" table with attributes like name and location.\n- A \"User\" table with attributes like username, email, password, and role (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nDefine relationships between these tables (e.g., many-to-many between Song and Artist). Ensure the schema is normalized and scalable.\n```\n\n## 4. Hosting and Deployment\n```\nProvide a deployment plan for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" that uses:\n- React.js for the frontend, hosted on Vercel.\n- Node.js with Express.js for the backend, hosted on Render.\n- PostgreSQL for the database, hosted on Supabase or Railway.\nEnsure the deployment is cost-effective (free tier) and includes CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.\n```\n\n## 5. Authentication and Authorization\n```\nImplement authentication and authorization for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Passport.js or Auth0. The system should:\n- Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.\n- Use JWT for session management.\n- Support role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: Admin, Contributor, and Basic.\n- Restrict CRUD operations to Admin and Contributor roles.\nProvide detailed documentation for integrating the authentication system with the frontend and backend.\n```\n\n## 6. Testing\n```\nWrite unit and integration tests for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Jest and Cypress. The tests should cover:\n- Frontend components (React.js) for browsing, searching, and CRUD operations.\n- Backend API endpoints (Node.js + Express.js) for authentication, role management, and CRUD operations.\n- Database interactions (PostgreSQL) for reading and writing data.\nEnsure the tests are comprehensive and include edge cases.\n```\n\n## 7. API Documentation\n```\nGenerate API documentation for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation should include:\n- Endpoints for CRUD operations on Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label entities.\n- Authentication endpoints for login and user management.\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) details for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\nProvide example requests and responses for each endpoint.\n```\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!",

Hosting and Deployment\n```\nProvide a deployment plan for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" that uses:\n- React.js for the frontend, hosted on Vercel.\n- Node.js with Express.js for the backend, hosted on Render.\n- PostgreSQL for the database, hosted on Supabase or Railway.\nEnsure the deployment is cost-effective (free tier) and includes CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.\n```\n\n## 5. Authentication and Authorization\n```\nImplement authentication and authorization for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Passport.js or Auth0. The system should:\n- Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.\n- Use JWT for session management.\n- Support role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: Admin, Contributor, and Basic.\n- Restrict CRUD operations to Admin and Contributor roles.\nProvide detailed documentation for integrating the authentication system with the frontend and backend.\n```\n\n## 6. Testing\n```\nWrite unit and integration tests for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Jest and Cypress. The tests should cover:\n- Frontend components (React.js) for browsing, searching, and CRUD operations.\n- Backend API endpoints (Node.js + Express.js) for authentication, role management, and CRUD operations.\n- Database interactions (PostgreSQL) for reading and writing data.\nEnsure the tests are comprehensive and include edge cases.\n```\n\n## 7. API Documentation\n```\nGenerate API documentation for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation should include:\n- Endpoints for CRUD operations on Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label entities.\n- Authentication endpoints for login and user management.\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) details for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\nProvide example requests and responses for each endpoint.\n```\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"

Frontend Development\nDesign a modern, responsive frontend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using React.js. The app should allow users to:\n- Browse and search song data, including relationships between songs, authors, artists, and record labels.\n- Perform CRUD operations for privileged users (Admin and Contributor roles).\n- Create and log in to user accounts with role-based access control (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nUse Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux or Context API for state management. Ensure the UI is intuitive and mobile-friendly.\n\n2. Backend Development\nDevelop a scalable backend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Node.js and Express.js. The backend should:\n- Provide RESTful API endpoints for the frontend and external apps.\n- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\n- Include authentication and authorization using Passport.js or Auth0 with JWT.\n- Handle CRUD operations for entities like Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label.\n- Use PostgreSQL as the database, with Sequelize or Prisma as the ORM.\nDocument the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.\n\n3. Database Design\nDesign a relational database schema for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using PostgreSQL. The schema should include:\n- A \"Song\" table with attributes like title, release date, and genre.\n- An \"Author\" table with attributes like name and biography.\n- An \"Artist\" table with attributes like name and discography.\n- A \"Record Label\" table with attributes like name and location.\n- A \"User\" table with attributes like username, email, password, and role (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nDefine relationships between these tables (e.g., many-to-many between Song and Artist). Ensure the schema is normalized and scalable.\n\n4. Hosting and Deployment\nProvide a deployment plan for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" that uses:\n- React.js for the frontend, hosted on Vercel.\n- Node.js with Express.js for the backend, hosted on Render.\n- PostgreSQL for the database, hosted on Supabase or Railway.\nEnsure the deployment is cost-effective (free tier) and includes CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.\n\n5.

Copy the content below into the file.\n\n---\n\n### File: `songtrace-prompts.txt`\n```plaintext\n1. Frontend Development\nDesign a modern, responsive frontend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using React.js. The app should allow users to:\n- Browse and search song data, including relationships between songs, authors, artists, and record labels.\n- Perform CRUD operations for privileged users (Admin and Contributor roles).\n- Create and log in to user accounts with role-based access control (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nUse Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux or Context API for state management. Ensure the UI is intuitive and mobile-friendly.\n\n2. Backend Development\nDevelop a scalable backend for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Node.js and Express.js. The backend should:\n- Provide RESTful API endpoints for the frontend and external apps.\n- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\n- Include authentication and authorization using Passport.js or Auth0 with JWT.\n- Handle CRUD operations for entities like Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label.\n- Use PostgreSQL as the database, with Sequelize or Prisma as the ORM.\nDocument the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.\n\n3. Database Design\nDesign a relational database schema for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using PostgreSQL. The schema should include:\n- A \"Song\" table with attributes like title, release date, and genre.\n- An \"Author\" table with attributes like name and biography.\n- An \"Artist\" table with attributes like name and discography.\n- A \"Record Label\" table with attributes like name and location.\n- A \"User\" table with attributes like username, email, password, and role (Admin, Contributor, Basic).\nDefine relationships between these tables (e.g., many-to-many between Song and Artist). Ensure the schema is normalized and scalable.\n\n4. Hosting and Deployment\nProvide a deployment plan for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" that uses:\n- React.js for the frontend, hosted on Vercel.\n- Node.js with Express.js for the backend, hosted on Render.\n- PostgreSQL for the database, hosted on Supabase or Railway.\nEnsure the deployment is cost-effective (free tier) and includes CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.\n\n5. Authentication and Authorization\nImplement authentication and authorization for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Passport.js or Auth0. The system should:\n- Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.\n- Use JWT for session management.\n- Support role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: Admin, Contributor, and Basic.\n- Restrict CRUD operations to Admin and Contributor roles.\nProvide detailed documentation for integrating the authentication system with the frontend and backend.\n\n6. Testing\nWrite unit and integration tests for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Jest and Cypress. The tests should cover:\n- Frontend components (React.js) for browsing, searching, and CRUD operations.\n- Backend API endpoints (Node.js + Express.js) for authentication, role management, and CRUD operations.\n- Database interactions (PostgreSQL) for reading and writing data.\nEnsure the tests are comprehensive and include edge cases.\n\n7. API Documentation\nGenerate API documentation for a SaaS app called \"SongTrace\" using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation should include:\n- Endpoints for CRUD operations on Song, Author, Artist, and Record Label entities.\n- Authentication endpoints for login and user management.\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) details for Admin, Contributor, and Basic roles.\nProvide example requests and responses for each endpoint.\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"
