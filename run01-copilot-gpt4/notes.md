# Run 01 - Copilot + GPT4

First attempt with a very basic prompt to see what happens. When I started it with "Architect" I was intending to get code design but it actually generated a complete project. However the service layer is incomplete and it does not appear to read/write any data. I was also expecting some detail about technology choices. The architecture doc is completely lacking. It appears to have chosen mongoose for data but there is only a model. I have not tried to run it yet or looked at the front end, for which it chose React. Abandoning for a new attempt to produce only a system design.
