# songtrace
Trace the origins of songs.

General premise of the app is to show the history of songs from author to various recordings and derivations. The app will have a UI for viewing as well as an interface for adding/managing data. There could also be automated processes to scrape data from external sources such as other API's.

Currently experimenting with AI code generation. There will be subfolders for each attempt and the prompts stored in text files at the root: ai-<tool>-vN.txt.
