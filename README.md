# songtrace
Trace the origins of songs.

General premise of the app is to show the history of songs from author to various recordings and derivations. The app will have a UI for viewing as well as an interface for adding/managing data. There could also be automated processes to scrape data from external sources such as other API's.

**I'm currently experimenting with AI, initially with VS Code's copilot which uses GPT4 on GitHub (other models are available). There are subfolders for each attempt (run01-copilot-gpt4, etc.) and notes and sessions are saved in notes.md and chat.json. Ctrl+Shift+P and select Chat: Import Chat to load up the copilot session.**
