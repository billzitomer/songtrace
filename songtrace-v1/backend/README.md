# SongTrace Backend Documentation

## Overview
The SongTrace backend is a modern SaaS application designed to manage and trace information about songs, their origins, and various versions by different artists. This application is built using open-source technologies and is licensed under the MIT license.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing song, artist, and user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Project Structure
The backend project is organized as follows:

```
backend/
