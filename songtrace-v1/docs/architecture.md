# Architecture of the SongTrace Application

## Overview
The SongTrace application is a modern SaaS platform designed to provide users with the ability to view and contribute information about songs, focusing on tracing their origins and various versions by different artists. The application is built with a microservices architecture, separating the frontend and backend functionalities to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
  - Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
  - Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - TypeScript: For type safety and better development experience.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing song and artist data.

## Application Structure
### Frontend
- **Components**: Contains reusable UI components such as `SongList`, `SongDetail`, `ArtistList`, and `ArtistDetail`.
- **Pages**: Contains main application pages like `HomePage`, `AdminPage`, and `LoginPage`.
- **Services**: Contains API service files for handling requests to the backend.

### Backend
- **Controllers**: Manages the logic for handling requests and responses for songs, artists, and authentication.
- **Models**: Defines the data structure for songs, artists, and users.
- **Routes**: Sets up the endpoints for the API, connecting them to the appropriate controllers.
- **Services**: Contains business logic for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Data Model
The primary entity in the application is the **Song**, which has relationships with other entities such as:
- **Artist**: Represents the artist who performed the song.
- **Author**: Represents the songwriter or composer of the song.
- **Record Label**: Represents the label that produced the song.

## User Interface
The application features two main UIs:
1. **Public UI**: For general users to browse and search for songs and artists.
2. **Admin UI**: For privileged users to manage the data with typical CRUD operations.

## API
The application exposes a RESTful API that allows both the frontend and other applications to interact with the backend services. The API supports operations for managing songs, artists, and user authentication.

## Deployment
The application is designed to run in a free cloud environment, ensuring that all technologies used are open-source and appropriately licensed. The backend can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or Vercel, while the frontend can be hosted on services like Netlify or GitHub Pages.

## Conclusion
The SongTrace application aims to provide a comprehensive platform for music enthusiasts to explore and contribute to the rich history of songs and their artists. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, the application is built to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly.
